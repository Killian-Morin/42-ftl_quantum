# ftl_quantum branch qiskit_pre_0.40.0

The subject of the first exercice: Token asks us to use the `IBMQ.get_provider()` function to get info on simulated and real quantum computers. However the `IBMQ` object, part of the package `qiskit-ibmq-provider` (https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibmq-provider) is deprecated.

So in this branch I tried to install a previous version of qiskit to use `IBMQ.get_provider()` but still can't make it for it to work.

I get the following error: cannot import name 'IBMQ' from partially initialized module 'qiskitâ€™.
